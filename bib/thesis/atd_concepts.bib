which work as expedient in the short term, but later negatively impact system evolvability and maintainability.
Over the years numerous approaches have been proposed to detect particular types of ATD at a refined level
of granularity via source code analysis. Nevertheless, how to gain an encompassing overview of the ATD
present in a software-intensive system is still an open question. In this study, we present a multi-step approach
designed to build an ATD index (ATDx), which provides insights into a set of ATD dimensions building
upon existing architectural rules by leveraging statistical analysis. The ATDx approach can be adopted by
researchers and practitioners alike in order to gain a better understanding of the nature of the ATD present in
software-intensive systems, and provides a systematic framework to implement concrete instances of ATDx
according to specific project and organizational needs",

  abstract     = "Architectural technical debt in a software-intensive system is driven by design decisions about its structure, frameworks, technologies, languages, etc. Unlike code-level technical debt, which can be readily detected by static analysers, and can often be refactored with minimal efforts, architectural debt is hard to detect, and its remediation is wide-ranging, daunting, and often avoided. The objective of this study is to develop a better understanding of how software development organisations conceptualize their architectural debt, and how they deal with it, if at all. We used a grounded theory method, eliciting qualitative data from software architects and senior technical staff from a wide range of software development organizations. The result of the study, i.e., the theory emerging from the collected data, constitutes an encompassing conceptual theory of architectural debt, identifying and relating concepts such as symptoms, causes, consequences, and management strategies. By grounding the findings in empirical data, the theory provides researchers and practitioners with evidence of which crucial factors of architectural technical debt are experienced in industrial contexts.",
