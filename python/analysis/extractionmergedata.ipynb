       "208  Isolation, autonomy, and loose coupling are critical success factors of microservice architectures. Unfortunately, systems tend to become strongly coupled over time, sometimes even exhibiting cyclic communication chains, making the individual deployment of services challenging. Such chains are highly problematic when strongly coupled communication e.g. based on synchronous invocations is used, but also create complexity and maintenance issues in more loosely coupled asynchronous or event-bas...  \n",

There are 68 different types of refactoring techniques and each technique has a particular purpose and effect.
