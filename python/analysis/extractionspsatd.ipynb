Furthermore, we investigated the correlation between the refactoring efforts and two static code metrics of the refactored code, mainly, the LOC and the complexity. The research revealed a moderate correlation between the refactoring efforts and each one of the size of the project and code complexity. Finally, we applied the DesigniteJava tool and machine learning practices to verify our research results. From the analysis we found a significant correlation between the ranking of the architecture smells and the ranking of refactoring efforts for each package.\nUsing machine learning practices, we took the architecture smells level and the code metrics of each release as an input to predict the levels of the refactoring effort of the next release. We calculated the results using our model and found that we can predict the higher refactoring cost levels with 93% accuracy., , https://researchrepository.wvu.edu/etd/7711/\n---\n44, hanssen2019identifying, 2019, ['Geir Hanssen', 'Gunnar Brataas', 'Antonio Martini'], Identifying scalability debt in open systems, Architectural technical debt can be generated by changes in the business and the environment of an organization. In this paper, we emphasize the change in scalability requirements due to new regulations. Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increased workload. For complex systems that are abruptly exposed via open interfaces and hence a greater workload, the scalability requirements may quickly increase, leading to technical debt. We term this scalability debt. This paper describes scalability triage, a light-weight, novel technique for identifying scalability threats as a form of technical debt. We illustrate this technique with an open banking case from a large software organization. Open banking is partly caused by the new European PSD2 regulative that enforce banks to open interfaces to unknown third-party actors. Banking systems are well-established, mature systems. However, with the advent of open banking and PSD2, the workload may quickly rocket. This leads to tougher scalability requirements and accumulated architectural debt, despite previously sound architectural decisions. Using scalability triage, such risks may be identified fast. It will then be possible to prevent this form of technical debt with timely reengineering., 2019 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Technical Debt (TechDebt), https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8785983?casa_token=JqZSSwow-DcAAAAA:_sZU-rPAEPXj_lbOiOHCzmrOlkBxfjBaZW1_WhHjDQf0J5FwgPhaN5XsBVyiXGSdul9xEYTqsrc\n---\n45, biaggi2018architectural, 2018, ['Andrea Biaggi', 'Francesca Fontana', 'Riccardo Roveda'], An architectural smells detection tool for c and c++ projects, Architectural smells gained great attention in the past few years since they directly affect software quality and increase architectural technical debt.

If not properly managed the interest on this debt may continue to accrue, severely hampering system stability and quality and impacting the team's ability to deliver enhancements at a pace that satisfies business needs. Although unmanaged debt can have disastrous results, strategically managed debt can help businesses and organizations take advantage of time-sensitive opportunities, fulfill market needs and acquire stakeholder feedback. Because architecture has such leverage within the overall development life cycle, strategic management of architectural debt is of primary importance. Some aspects of technical debt - but not all technical debt - affects product quality.

We present a summary of current understanding of the technical debt concept and propose a broader application of the approach at a system level. The technical debt metaphor provides a method to identify cases when design or implementation decisions are being made for expediency and assess their long term impact on productivity and risk. In addition, technical debt management offers a logical approach to tracking expedient decisions and determining when it makes sense to carry the debt and when it's better to pay it off by updating designed and retrofitting units. In this paper, we describe various kinds of technical debt that may be present in a system baseline and consider how the presence of debt impacts further evolution of the system. Types of debt include architectural debt, configuration debt, testing debt and deprecation debt among others. We also present use case studies that illustrate how technical debt assessment and management can have a positive impact on system realization. Cases include moving a baseline from R&D to operations, reusing a baseline in a new context, and planning a technical refresh.

An important component of technical debt relates to decisions about system architecture. As systems grow and evolve, their architectures can degrade, increasing maintenance costs and reducing developer productivity. This raises the question if and when it might be appropriate to redesign (“refactor”) a system, to reduce what has been called “architectural debt”. Unfortunately, we lack robust data by which to evaluate the relationship between architectural design choices and system maintenance costs, and hence to predict the value that might be released through such refactoring efforts.\nWe address this gap by analyzing the relationship between system architecture and maintenance costs for two software systems of similar size, but with very different structures, one has a “Hierarchical” design, the other has a “Core-Periphery” design. We measure the level of system coupling for the 20,000+ components in each system, and use these measures to predict maintenance efforts, or “defect-related activity.” We show that in both systems, the tightly-coupled Core or Central components cost significantly more to maintain then loosely-coupled Peripheral components. In essence, a small number of components generate a large proportion of system costs. However, we find major differences in the potential benefits available from refactoring these systems, related to their differing designs. Our results generate insight into how architectural debt can be assessed by understanding patterns of coupling among components in a system., Journal of Systems and Software, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121216300760?casa_token=6qbSULM6HIwAAAAA:bbVHLxaR-8GA02fa2njL5810UafN77Ch2D3FBqg0fyvqShmPRr7mGvohg2yFrZsKfQybVXqbDrs\n---\n51, fontana2016tool, 2016, ['Francesca Fontana', 'Riccardo Roveda', 'Marco Zanoni'], Tool support for evaluating architectural debt of an existing system: An experience report, During software development, maintenance and evolution, we can assess the quality of code, design and architecture to capture hints of possible problems and face them as soon as possible.

Architecture technical debt is a subset of technical debt, when software practitioners make wrong or sub-optimal decisions related to the architecture of the software. Identifying such architecture technical debt plays a crucial role in software quality.

Based on the outcomes of our review: (1) design rule space and traceability graphs are the dominant techniques, (2) despite the increase of automated techniques in identifying architecture debt, pure manual methods using expert opinion is still popular, (3) majority of the approaches use code/version history to mine archictural technical debt, (4) the field is getting increasingly more attraction in the last five years., 2020 Turkish National Software Engineering Symposium (UYMS), https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9247070\n---\n53, kazman2015case, 2015, ['Rick Kazman', 'Yuanfang Cai', 'Ran Mo', 'Qiong Feng', 'Lu Xiao', 'Serge Haziyev', 'Volodymyr Fedak', 'Andriy Shapochka'], A case study in locating the architectural roots of technical debt, Our recent research has shown that, in large-scale software systems, defective files seldom exist alone. They are usually architecturally connected, and their architectural structures exhibit significant design flaws which propagate bugginess among files. We call these flawed structures the architecture roots, a type of technical debt that incurs high maintenance penalties. Removing the architecture roots of bugginess requires refactoring, but the benefits of refactoring have historically been difficult for architects to quantify or justify. In this paper, we present a case study of identifying and quantifying such architecture debts in a large-scale industrial software project. Our approach is to model and analyze software architecture as a set of design rule spaces (DRSpaces). Using data extracted from the project's development artifacts, we were able to identify the files implicated in architecture flaws and suggest refactorings based on removing these flaws. Then we built economic models of the before and (predicted) after states, which gave the organization confidence that doing the refactorings made business sense, in terms of a handsome return on investment., 2015 IEEE/ACM 37th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7202962?casa_token=3gxbSUBzw7wAAAAA:bq2Q3yufYkE99EuzSveRKY2U1lzMGQZVxtvd-0WCHZtkGq0TspgeQHJwlfcgu-xZqYsm2IaylOk\n---\n54, soliman2021architectural, 2021, ['Mohamed Soliman', 'Paris Avgeriou', 'Yikun Li'], Architectural design decisions that incur technical debt—An industrial case study, Context:\nDuring software development, some architectural design decisions incur technical debt, either deliberately or inadvertently. These have serious impact on the quality of a software system, and can cost significant time and effort to be changed. While current research efforts have explored general concepts of architectural design decisions and technical debt separately, debt-incurring architectural design decisions have not been specifically explored in practice.\nObjective:\nIn this case study, we explore debt-incurring architectural design decisions (DADDs) in practice. Specifically, we explore the main types of DADDs, why and how they are incurred in a software system, and how practitioners deal with these types of design decisions.\nMethod:\nWe performed interviews and a focus group with practitioners working in embedded and enterprise software companies, discussing their concrete experience with such architectural design decisions.\nResults:\nWe provide the following contributions: 1) A categorization for the types of DADDs, which extend a current ontology on architectural design decisions. 2) A process on how deliberate DADDs are made in practice. 3) A conceptual model which shows the relationships between the causes and triggers of inadvertent DADDs. 4) The main factors that influence the way of dealing with DADDs.\nConclusion:\nThe results can support the development of new approaches and tools for Architecture Technical Debt management from the perspective of Design Decisions.

An analysis of technical debt causes, Technical debt is a metaphor used to describe technical decisions that can give the company a benefit in the short term but possibly hurting the overall quality of the software in the long term. Architectural decisions are considered one of the most common sources of technical debt, therefore, it becomes relevant to understand what causes lead to technical debt from the point of view of software architects. To accomplish this task, we used a survey research method to collect and analyze a corpus of 28 software architects from Colombia, as a part of the InsighTD project. Results showed that inappropriate planning is the most cited technical debt cause by software architects. However, results differ when comparison against engineers and manager are performed. Innacurate time estimate and producing more without quality were the most selected causes of technical debt according to engineers and managers. To improve this comparison, the rank-biased overlapping technique was used. As more elements were compared, more similar were these lists of causes among all three roles, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, nan\n---\nSucesso!
