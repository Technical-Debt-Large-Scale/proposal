If not properly managed the interest on this debt may continue to accrue, severely hampering system stability and quality and impacting the team's ability to deliver enhancements at a pace that satisfies business needs. Although unmanaged debt can have disastrous results, strategically managed debt can help businesses and organizations take advantage of time-sensitive opportunities, fulfill market needs and acquire stakeholder feedback. Because architecture has such leverage within the overall development life cycle, strategic management of architectural debt is of primary importance. Some aspects of technical debt - but not all technical debt - affects product quality. This tutorial introduces the technical debt metaphor, the various types of technical debt, and in particular structural or architectural debt, the techniques for measuring and communicating this technical debt, and its relationship with software quality, both internal and external quality.</p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6319262?casa_token=he4B2QD8rEgAAAAA:hjv8bjHrgxHPllPj6cocrBTqmABd_Ss1WDU3EP4K0MJiCbvs_OjVlIbcaC30SKyASOQ6JMDV5BQ">link</a><br><h2>Título 20: Strategic management of architectural technical debt</h2><h3>Autores: [Ipek Ozkaya]</h3><h4>Ano: 2012</h4><h4>Local: </h4><p>A presentation about Software Architecture and Technical Debt</p><a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA611121.pdf">link</a><br><h2>Título 21: Architecture technical debt: Understanding causes and a qualitative model</h2><h3>Autores: [Antonio Martini, Jan Bosch, Michel Chaudron]</h3><h4>Ano: 2014</h4><h4>Local: 2014 40th EUROMICRO Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications</h4><p>A known problem in large software companies is to balance the prioritization of short-term with long-term responsiveness.

In most cases, ATD is not effectively managed in the architecting process: It is not made explicit, and architecture decision making does not consider the ATD incurred by the different design options. This chapter proposes a conceptual model of ATD and an architectural technical debt management process applying this ATD conceptual model in order to facilitate decision making in a value-oriented perspective of architecting. We also demonstrate how ATD management can be employed in architectural synthesis and evaluation in a case study. The contribution of this work provides a controllable and predictable balance between the value and cost of architecture design in the long term.</p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012410464800009X">link</a><br><h2>Título 7: An empirical investigation of modularity metrics for indicating architectural technical debt</h2><h3>Autores: [Zengyang Li, Peng Liang, Paris Avgeriou, Nicolas Guelfi, Apostolos Ampatzoglou]</h3><h4>Ano: 2014</h4><h4>Local: Proceedings of the 10th international ACM Sigsoft conference on Quality of software architectures</h4><p>Architectural technical debt (ATD) is incurred by design decisions that consciously or unconsciously compromise system-wide quality attributes, particularly maintainability and evolvability. ATD needs to be identified and measured, so that it can be monitored and eventually repaid, when appropriate. In practice, ATD is difficult to identify and measure, since ATD does not yield observable behaviors to end users. One indicator of ATD, is the average number of modified components per commit (ANMCC): a higher ANMCC indicates more ATD in a software system. However, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to calculate ANMCC, because the data (i.e., the log of commits) are not always available. In this work, we propose to use software modularity metrics, which can be directly calculated based on source code, as a substitute of ANMCC to indicate ATD. We validate the correlation between ANMCC and modularity metrics through a holistic multiple case study on thirteen open source software projects. The results of this study suggest that two modularity metrics, namely Index of Package Changing Impact (IPCI) and Index of Package Goal Focus (IPGF), have significant correlation with ANMCC, and therefore can be used as alternative ATD indicators.</p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2602576.2602581?casa_token=3c7z1hpCJ2oAAAAA:dAQ5XeHjJEz6pbCtU-F14v47YlAY_HH7jaeCSa-Iw2WIwNIj4dJi2AH41CdpUcC3_enGiMF83OVuUA">link</a><br><h2>Título 3: The danger of architectural technical debt: Contagious debt and vicious circles</h2><h3>Autores: [Antonio Martini, Jan Bosch]</h3><h4>Ano: 2015</h4><h4>Local: 2015 12th Working IEEE/IFIP Conference on Software Architecture</h4><p>A known problem in large software companies is to balance the prioritization of short-term with long-term viability. Specifically, architecture violations (Architecture Technical Debt) taken to deliver fast might hinder future feature development. However, some technical debt requires more interest to be paid than other. We have investigated which Technical Debt items generate more effort and how this effort is manifested during software development. We conducted a multiple-case embedded case study comprehending 7 sites at 5 large international software companies. We found that some Technical Debt items are contagious, causing other parts of the system to be contaminated with the same problem, which may lead to non-linear growth of interest. We also identify another socio-technical phenomenon, for which a combination of weak awareness of debt, time pressure and refactoring creates Vicious Circles of events during the development. Such phenomena need to be identified and stopped before the development is led to a crisis point. Finally, this paper presents a taxonomy of the most dangerous items identified during the qualitative investigation and a model of their effects that can be used for prioritization, for further investigation and as a quality model for extracting more precise and context-specific metrics.</p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7158498">link</a><br><h2>Título 6: Investigating Architectural Technical Debt accumulation and refactoring over time: A multiple-case study</h2><h3>Autores: [Antonio Martini, Jan Bosch, Michel Chaudron]</h3><h4>Ano: 2015</h4><h4>Local: Information and Software Technology</h4><p>A known problem in large software companies is to balance the prioritizaion of short-term with long-term feature delivery speed. Specifically, Architecture Technical Debt is regarded as sub-optimal architectural solutions taken to deliver fast that might hinder future feature development, which, in turn, would hinder agility.
This paper aims at improving software management by shedding light on the current factors responsible for the accumulation of Architectural Technical Debt and to understand how it evolves over time.
We conducted an exploratory multiple-case embedded case study in 7 sites at 5 large companies. We evaluated the results with additional cross-company interviews and an in-depth, company-specific case study in which we initially evaluate factors and models.
We compiled a taxonomy of the factors and their influence in the accumulation of Architectural Technical Debt, and we provide two qualitative models of how the debt is accumulated and refactored over time in the studied companies. We also list a set of exploratory propositions on possible refactoring strategies that can be useful as insights for practitioners and as hypotheses for further research.
Several factors cause constant and unavoidable accumulation of Architecture Technical Debt, which leads to development crises. Refactorings are often overlooked in prioritization and they are often triggered by development crises, in a reactive fashion. Some of the factors are manageable, while others are external to the companies. ATD needs to be made visible, in order to postpone the crises according to the strategic goals of the companies. There is a need for practices and automated tools to proactively manage ATD.</p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584915001287?casa_token=d7FY9GBzKp0AAAAA:BHpXI25mQC3q_lrj_XM5T7_tpFwjjVahOnuqFpodZWFOBT_NeRVTvGxVCSO__lV6fN_3re0Encg">link</a><br><h2>Título 8: Architectural technical debt identification based on architecture decisions and change scenarios</h2><h3>Autores: [Zengyang Li, Peng Liang, Paris Avgeriou]</h3><h4>Ano: 2015</h4><h4>Local: 2015 12th Working IEEE/IFIP Conference on Software Architecture</h4><p>Architectural technical debt (ATD) is incurred by design decisions that intentionally or unintentionally compromise system-wide quality attributes, particularly maintainability and evolvability. ATD is harmful to the system's long-term health, thus it needs to be identified for further management. However, existing ATD identification approaches are mainly based on source code analysis and thus suffer from certain shortcomings: they can only identify issues at the system implementation, they can only be employed after the systems is implemented in code, they lack a mechanism to confirm whether the potential ATD identified is real ATD or not. To address these issues, we proposed an ATD identification approach based on architecture decisions and change scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness and usability of this approach, we conducted a case study with an information system in a large telecommunications company. The results show that the proposed approach is useful and easy to use, and it supports release planning and ATD interest measurement.</p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7158505">link</a><br><h2>Título 53: A case study in locating the architectural roots of technical debt</h2><h3>Autores: [Rick Kazman, Yuanfang Cai, Ran Mo, Qiong Feng, Lu Xiao, Serge Haziyev, Volodymyr Fedak, Andriy Shapochka]</h3><h4>Ano: 2015</h4><h4>Local: 2015 IEEE/ACM 37th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering</h4><p>Our recent research has shown that, in large-scale software systems, defective files seldom exist alone. They are usually architecturally connected, and their architectural structures exhibit significant design flaws which propagate bugginess among files. We call these flawed structures the architecture roots, a type of technical debt that incurs high maintenance penalties. Removing the architecture roots of bugginess requires refactoring, but the benefits of refactoring have historically been difficult for architects to quantify or justify. In this paper, we present a case study of identifying and quantifying such architecture debts in a large-scale industrial software project. Our approach is to model and analyze software architecture as a set of design rule spaces (DRSpaces). Using data extracted from the project's development artifacts, we were able to identify the files implicated in architecture flaws and suggest refactorings based on removing these flaws. Then we built economic models of the before and (predicted) after states, which gave the organization confidence that doing the refactorings made business sense, in terms of a handsome return on investment.</p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7202962?casa_token=3gxbSUBzw7wAAAAA:bq2Q3yufYkE99EuzSveRKY2U1lzMGQZVxtvd-0WCHZtkGq0TspgeQHJwlfcgu-xZqYsm2IaylOk">link</a><br><h2>Título 19: Applicability of technical debt as a concept to understand obstacles for evolution of automated production systems</h2><h3>Autores: [Birgit Vogel-Heuser, Susanne R{\"o}sch]</h3><h4>Ano: 2015</h4><h4>Local: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics</h4><p>Automated production systems (aPS), a specific class of mechatronic systems, are complex, long living, software intensive, evolving systems designed according to customer request. Often, the evolution of such systems has to cope with imponderables and sudden disturbances of the systematic development or maintenance process. In software engineering, the concept of technical debt and, in more detail, architectural technical debt has been introduced recently to describe phenomena, which increase software development costs over time. This paper tries to adapt and apply the classification of technical debt and architectural technical debt to automated production systems, identifying similar dimensions but adding specific challenges, causes and their effects. Once the causes and effects are identified, management and recovery strategies coping with technical debt and architectural technical debt shall be developed in the future, thereby enlarging the strategies from software engineering. The adapted classification and adaptations are based on the experience of several industrial projects in aPS.</p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7379167?casa_token=Is7_uUN68_wAAAAA:cHVb1og-yWxQ0QK3cLx_YO-OoW7oYmcKk4MpWmEsHzWoXPr0UQ4gItloWN08gTD0AIhHByw_rj4">link</a><br><h2>Título 29: Identifying and visualizing Architectural Debt and its efficiency interest in the automotive domain: A case study</h2><h3>Autores: [Ulf Eliasson, Antonio Martini, Robert Kaufmann, Sam Odeh]</h3><h4>Ano: 2015</h4><h4>Local: 2015 IEEE 7th International Workshop on Managing Technical Debt (MTD)</h4><p>Architectural Technical Debt has recently received the attention of the scientific community, as a suitable metaphor for describing sub-optimal architectural solutions having short-term benefits but causing a long-term negative impact. We study such phenomenon in the context of Volvo Car Group, where the development of modern cars includes complex systems with mechanical components, electronics and software working together in a complicated network to perform an increasing number of functions and meet the demands of many customers. This puts high requirements on having an architecture and design that can handle these demands. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to manage Architecture Technical Debt, in order to make sure that the advantages of sub-optimal solutions do not lead to the payment of a large interest. We conducted a case study at Volvo Car Group and we discovered that architectural violations in the detailed design had an impact on the efficiency of the communication between components, which is an essential quality in cars and other embedded systems. Such interest is not studied in literature, which usually focuses on the maintainability aspects of Technical Debt. To explore how this Architectural Technical Debt and its interest could be communicated to stakeholders, we developed a visual tool. We found that not only was the Architectural Debt highly interesting for the architects and other stakeholders at VCG, but the proposed visualization was useful in increasing the awareness of the impact that Architectural Technical Debt had on efficiency.</p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7332622?casa_token=Haikn-61XoAAAAAA:5Xiilm_88gAxGk4XZ4LCyfcmLS4-wGtzE6-IZf0ob9uS6dfzMuXa9DI4x3VbZmWTKrAItoKi2XM">link</a><br><h2>Título 24: Towards prioritizing architecture technical debt: information needs of architects and product owners</h2><h3>Autores: [Antonio Martini, Jan Bosch]</h3><h4>Ano: 2015</h4><h4>Local: 2015 41St euromicro conference on software engineering and advanced applications</h4><p>Architectural Technical Debt is a metaphor for representing sub-optimal architectural solutions that might cause an interest, in terms of effort or quality, to be paid by the organization in the long run. Such metaphor has been regarded as useful for communicating risks of suboptimal solutions between technical and non-technical stakeholders. However, it's fundamental to understand the information needs of the involved stakeholders in order to produce technical debt measurements that would allow proper communication and informed prioritization.

Unmanaged technical debt, especially architectural technical debt, can lead to additional development overhead and expensive refactoring. However, most research that address architectural technical debt does so by analyzing source code, very little research focus on a more abstract level. The problem with analyzing source code to identify debt is that it is not enough to cover all debt. Similarly, most visualisation of software architecture target lower level artifacts based on static code analysis. Therefore there is a gap in both addressing architectural technical debt and software visualisation on a more abstract level. By utilizing a case study at a company, followed by design research, we contribute to filling this gap by identifying, measuring, and visualizing architectural debt on a higher abstraction level. Specifically, we identify occurring debt items related to efficiency interest and propose methodologies to measure and visualize them utilizing architectural models.

An important component of technical debt relates to decisions about system architecture. As systems grow and evolve, their architectures can degrade, increasing maintenance costs and reducing developer productivity. This raises the question if and when it might be appropriate to redesign (“refactor”) a system, to reduce what has been called “architectural debt”. Unfortunately, we lack robust data by which to evaluate the relationship between architectural design choices and system maintenance costs, and hence to predict the value that might be released through such refactoring efforts.
We address this gap by analyzing the relationship between system architecture and maintenance costs for two software systems of similar size, but with very different structures, one has a “Hierarchical” design, the other has a “Core-Periphery” design. We measure the level of system coupling for the 20,000+ components in each system, and use these measures to predict maintenance efforts, or “defect-related activity.” We show that in both systems, the tightly-coupled Core or Central components cost significantly more to maintain then loosely-coupled Peripheral components. In essence, a small number of components generate a large proportion of system costs. However, we find major differences in the potential benefits available from refactoring these systems, related to their differing designs. Our results generate insight into how architectural debt can be assessed by understanding patterns of coupling among components in a system.</p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121216300760?casa_token=6qbSULM6HIwAAAAA:bbVHLxaR-8GA02fa2njL5810UafN77Ch2D3FBqg0fyvqShmPRr7mGvohg2yFrZsKfQybVXqbDrs">link</a><br><h2>Título 28: Identification of architectural technical debt: An analysis based on naming patterns</h2><h3>Autores: [Paul Carpio]</h3><h4>Ano: 2016</h4><h4>Local: 2016 8th Euro American Conference on Telematics and Information Systems (EATIS)</h4><p>Hasty software development can produce immediate implementations with source code unnecessarily complex and hardly readable.

Currently, most approaches to managing TD focus on dealing with TD at source code level, while few methods deal with TD at architecture level. If architectural technical debt (ATD) is not effectively managed in the architecting process, the knowledge about ATD is not made available to involved stakeholders and the impact of ATD is not considered during architecture decision-making. Thus, the system’s maintainability and evolvability can be intentionally or unintentionally compromised. As a result, architectures are costly to maintain and new features are difficult to introduce. To facilitate the management of ATD, it needs to be documented so that it becomes explicit to stakeholders. To this end, we propose a set of architecture viewpoints related to ATD (ATD viewpoints in short). Each viewpoint frames a number of concerns related to ATD. These ATD viewpoints together help to get a comprehensive understanding of ATD in a software system, thereby providing support for architecture decision-making. To evaluate the effectiveness of the ATD viewpoints in documenting ATD, we conducted a case study in a large telecommunications company. The results of this case study show that the documented ATD views can effectively facilitate the documentation of ATD. Specifically, the ATD viewpoints are relatively easy to understand, it takes an acceptable amount of effort to document ATD using the ATD viewpoints, and the documented ATD views are useful for stakeholders to understand the ATD in the software project.</p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128023013000053">link</a><br><h2>Título 10: An empirically developed method to aid decisions on architectural technical debt refactoring: AnaConDebt</h2><h3>Autores: [Antonio Martini, Jan Bosch]</h3><h4>Ano: 2016</h4><h4>Local: 2016 IEEE/ACM 38th International Conference on Software Engineering Companion (ICSE-C)</h4><p>Architectural Technical Debt is regarded as sub-optimal architectural solutions that need to be refactored in order to avoid the payment of a costly interest in the future. However, decisions on if and when to refactor architecture are extremely important and difficult to take, since changing software at the architectural level is quite expensive. Therefore it is important, for software organizations, to have methods and tools that aid architects and managers to understand if Architecture Technical Debt will generate a costly and growing interest to be paid or not. Current knowledge, especially empirically developed and evaluated, is quite scarce. In this paper we developed and evaluated a method, AnaConDebt, by analyzing, together with several practitioners, 12 existing cases of Architecture Debt in 6 companies. The method has been refined several times in order to be useful and effective in practice. We also report the evaluation of the method with a final case, for which we present anonymized results and subsequent refactoring decisions. The method consists of several components that need to be analyzed, combining the theoretical Technical Debt framework and the practical experience of the practitioners, in order to identify the key factors involved in the growth of interest. The output of the method shows summarized indicators that visualizes the factors in a useful way for the stakeholders. This analysis aids the practitioners in deciding on if and when to refactor Architectural Technical Debt items. The method has been evaluated and has been proven useful to support the architects into systematically analyze and decide upon a case.</p><a href="nan">link</a><br><h2>Título 51: Tool support for evaluating architectural debt of an existing system: An experience report</h2><h3>Autores: [Francesca Fontana, Riccardo Roveda, Marco Zanoni]</h3><h4>Ano: 2016</h4><h4>Local: Proceedings of the 31st Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing</h4><p>During software development, maintenance and evolution, we can assess the quality of code, design and architecture to capture hints of possible problems and face them as soon as possible.

However, this can be hindered if both evolution and maintenance of existing systems are hampered by Architectural Technical Debt. To avoid the accumulation and the costly consequences of ATD, it is critical that the responsibilities to minimize it are well understood and shared in a large software organization. In this paper, we argue that an organizational model, based on a well validated framework such as CAFFEA, can be used to reveal sub-optimalities in the social structure of the organization: in other words, it can reveal Social Debt. Such sub-optimality, according to previous work, leads to the accumulation of ATD. In conclusion, using the CAFFEA framework as an organizational analysis tool, can reveal weak spots (Social Debt) in the organization and can help preventing costly ATD and its consequences.</p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7958479?casa_token=dvDgL3QwUq4AAAAA:Jr9XkEGeC5bGap2OJH00VsDK8S6bUBTk7dPQZPxk0Gf1VhMdPc8xNZTRpxWST3Dc0YqCoXwh6dE">link</a><br><h2>Título 36: Estimating Architectural Technical Debt: A design research</h2><h3>Autores: [Gustav Dahl]</h3><h4>Ano: 2017</h4><h4>Local: </h4><p>Technical debt(TD) and the sub-category architectural technical debt (ATD) are two software related buzzwords frequently used in both academia and in the software industry. The purpose of these terms is to make it easier to understand that a software decision might lead to an expected or unexpected consequence that could have an impact in the long-run. Hence, the TD level in a project needs to be under control. However, the common approach towards refactoring of a TD is to handle it when it is too late and a crisis has emerged due to its presence. In order to solve this and make the stakeholders able to determine when a TD should be refactored a tool has been developed. This tool incorporates the newly developed AnaConDebt model, which is an ATD refactoring decision model. The outcome from building and evaluating this proof-of-concept is that there is potential for such a tool but it is not yet there.

Besides the negative effects of Architectural Technical Debt on the overall software product quality in terms of hindering evolution and causing high maintenance costs, Architectural Technical Debt also has a significant negative impact on software practitioners' daily work. Although a great deal of theoretical work on Architectural Technical Debt has been undertaken, there is a lack of empirical studies that examine the negative effects of Architectural Technical Debt during the software development lifecycle. The aim of this study is to investigate how practitioners perceive and estimate the impact of Architectural Technical Debt during the software development process. This paper reports the results of an online web survey providing quantitative data from 258 participants. The contribution of this paper is threefold: First, it shows that practitioners experience that the Architectural type of Technical Debt has the highest negative impact on daily software development work. Secondly, we provide evidence that does not support the commonly held belief that Architectural Technical Debt increases with the age of the software. Thirdly, we show that despite different responsibilities and working tasks of software professionals, Architectural Technical Debt negatively affects all roles without any significant difference between the roles.</p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8051360?casa_token=an75znP_OP0AAAAA:Huxi_g0upkMrgDUI52mmhZtTwlH_CIVgzzEAC_R19zwMTr-oC6i26Cw4PhDyDxho4UjlGw9Vvo8">link</a><br><h2>Título 5: On the interest of architectural technical debt: Uncovering the contagious debt phenomenon</h2><h3>Autores: [Antonio Martini, Jan Bosch]</h3><h4>Ano: 2017</h4><h4>Local: Journal of Software: Evolution and Process</h4><p>A known problem in large software companies is to balance the prioritization of short-term and long-term business goals. As an example, architecture suboptimality (Architectural Technical Debt), incurred to deliver fast, might hinder future feature development. However, some technical debt generates more interest to be paid than other. We conducted a multi-phase, multiple-case embedded case study comprehending 9 sites at 6 large international software companies. We have investigated which architectural technical debt items generate more interest , how the interest occurs during software development and which costly extra-activities are triggered as a result. We presented a taxonomy of the most dangerous items identified during the qualitative investigation and a model of their effects that can be used for prioritization, for further investigation and as a quality model for extracting more precise and context-specific metrics. We found that some architectural technical debt items are contagious, causing the interest to be not only fixed, but potentially compound, which leads to the hidden growth of interest (possibly exponential). We found important factors to be monitored to refactor the debt before it becomes too costly. Instances of these phenomena need to be identified and stopped before the development reaches a crises.</p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smr.1877?casa_token=u1iterhvisEAAAAA%3AHMHqo8mniG9F7qZe-YYMoEPXwn6Zw0MSu7CnLloxoNNI2pkUWZlU_il7orMF2S6f6YSQJX7ODFcZSEKV">link</a><br><h2>Título 14: Identifying architectural technical debt in android applications through automated compliance checking</h2><h3>Autores: [Roberto Verdecchia]</h3><h4>Ano: 2018</h4><h4>Local: 2018 IEEE/ACM 5th International Conference on Mobile Software Engineering and Systems (MOBILESoft)</h4><p>By considering the fast pace at which mobile applications need to evolve, Architectural Technical Debt results to be a crucial yet implicit factor of success.

Hence, different architectural violations, detected as architectural smells, need to be identified and refactored. In this paper, we conducted a multiple case-study on several architectural smells detected in four industrial projects. We conducted an in-depth investigation with a questionnaire, interviews and thorough inspection of the code with the practitioners. We evaluated the negative impact of the technical debt detected by the architectural smells, their difficulty to be refactored and the usefulness of the detection tool.

A related phenomenon has been identified in Architectural Technical Debt: if the system architecture is sub-optimal for long-term business goals, it might need to be refactored. A key property of the system assuring long-term goals is its modularity, or else the degree to which components are decoupled: such property allows the product to be evolved without costly changes pervading the whole system. However, understanding the business benefits of refactoring to achieve modularity is not trivial, especially for large refactorings involving substantial architectural changes.The aim of this study was to develop a technique to identify Architectural Technical Debt in the form of a non-modularized component and to quantify the convenience of its repayment.
Method
We have conducted a single, embedded case study in a large company, comparing a component before and after it was refactored to achieve modularity. We have developed a holistic framework for the semi-automated identification and estimation of Architectural Technical Debt in the form of non-modularized components. We then evaluate the technique reporting a comparative study of the difference in maintenance and development costs in two coexisting systems, one including the refactored component and one including the non-refactored one.
The main contributions are a measurement system for the identification of the Architectural Technical Debt according to the stakeholders’ goals, a mathematical relationship for calculating and quantifying its interest in terms of extra-effort spent in additional development and maintenance, and an overall decision framework to assess the benefit of refactoring. We also report context-specific results that show the estimated benefits of refactoring the specific case of Architectural Technical Debt.
We found that it is possible to identify this kind of Architectural Technical Debt and to quantify its repayment convenience. Thanks to the developed framework, it was possible to estimate that the Architectural Technical Debt present in the component was causing substantial continuous extra-effort, and that the modularization would be repaid in several months of development and maintenance.</p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095058491630355X?casa_token=S2Eoc3WT6GUAAAAA:_0K7XROOoBNvPU1f06D5jFKqBhvj2bXP9Oh8-_dlXOaIvQLIC0z3QMTDQl3xzpr0PORDjSseBO4">link</a><br><h2>Título 30: Exploring the relationship between software modularity and technical debt</h2><h3>Autores: [Peggy Skiada, Apostolos Ampatzoglou, Elvira-Maria Arvanitou, Alexander Chatzigeorgiou, Ioannis Stamelos]</h3><h4>Ano: 2018</h4><h4>Local: 2018 44th Euromicro Conference on software engineering and advanced applications (SEAA)</h4><p>Modularity is one of the key principles of software design.

In this paper we explore coupling and cohesion metrics at the software package level-i.e., one of most basic levels of software functional decomposition in object-oriented (OO) systems, with the aim of investigating their relation to the technical debt of each package. Current state-of-the-art tools in TD measurement are working on the source code level, and the extent to which they can unveil limitations at the architecture level (e.g., violations of the modularity principle), has not been explored so far. To achieve this goal, we conducted a case study on 1,200 packages retrieved from 20 well-known open source software projects.

However, this can be impeded if the evolution and maintenance of existing systems is hampered by what has been recently termed Technical Debt (TD). Specifically, Architectural TD has received increased attention in the last few years due to its significant impact on system success and, left unchecked, it can cause expensive repercussions. It is therefore important to understand the underlying factors of architectural TD.

The contribution of this paper is the presentation of a novel descriptive model, providing a comprehensive interpretation of the architectural TD phenomenon. This model categorizes the main characteristics of architectural TD and reveals their relations. The results show that, by using this model, different stakeholders could increase the system's success rate, and lower the rate of negative consequences, by raising awareness about architectural TD.</p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121217302121?casa_token=YsOHRjpBJCkAAAAA:IBROO8zkqddpzoSZ_soHvgzLB3eMNJaldR6BcqkdGJGQX6lrDwAvI_3fi8Ep8vAcNc6-LX-kGjQ">link</a><br><h2>Título 34: An Empirical Investigation of the Harmfulness of Architectural Technical Debt</h2><h3>Autores: [Terese Besker]</h3><h4>Ano: 2018</h4><h4>Local: </h4><p>Background: In order to survive in today's fast-growing and ever fast-changing business
environments, large-scale software companies need to deliver customer value
continuously, both from a short- and long-term perspective. However, the consequences
of potential long-term and far-reaching negative effects of shortcuts and quick fixes
made during the software development lifecycle, described as Technical Debt (TD), can
impede the software development process.
Objective: The overall goal of this Licentiate thesis is to empirically study and
understand in what way and to what extent, TD in general and architectural TD
specifically, influence today’s software development work and, specifically, with the
intention of providing more quantitative insights into the field.
Method: To achieve the objectives, a combination of both quantitative and qualitative
research methodologies are used, including interviews, surveys, a systematic literature
review, a longitudinal study, correlation analysis, and statistical tests. In five of the seven
included studies, we use a combination of multiple research methods to achieve high
validity.
Results: We present results showing that software suffering from TD will cause various
different negative effects on both the software and on the developing process. These
negative effects can be illustrated from a technical, a financial and from a developer’s
working situational perspective.
Conclusion: This thesis contributes to the understanding and quantification of in what
way and to what extent TD is harmful to software development organizations. The results
show that software practitioners estimate that they waste 36% of their working time due
to experiencing TD and that the TD is causing them to perform additional timeconsuming work activities. This study also shows that, compared to all types of TD,
architectural TD has the greatest negative impact on the daily software development

However, some obstacles have been found, limiting the application of ASD to such a domain. This chapter focuses on one such challenges, the degradation of the system architecture over time, which is called, in literature, Architectural Technical Debt (ATD). Software engineering is an individual activity and the causes for ATD accumulation can be related to suboptimal decision taken by individual employees. New employees as well are more subjected to accumulating ATD due to the natural noncomplete understanding of the architecture and patterns. The chapter summarizes the causes, trends, consequences, and possible solutions related to the management of ATD.

A popular strategy is to use microservices architecture. However, such an architecture is also subject to debt, which hinders the continuous delivery process and thus negatively affects the software released to the customers.
Objectives: The aim of this study is to identify issues, solutions and risks related to Architecture Technical Debt in microservices.
Method: We conducted an exploratory case study of a real life project with about 1000 services in a large, international company. Through qualitative analysis of documents and interviews, we investigated Architecture Technical Debt in the communication layer of a system with microservices architecture.
Results: Our main contributions are a list of Architecture Technical Debt issues specific for the communication layer in a system with microservices architecture, as well as their associated negative impact (interest), a solution to repay the debt and the its cost (principal). Among the found Architecture Technical Debt issues were the existence of business logic in the communication layer and a high amount of point-to-point connections between services. The studied solution consists of the implementation of different canonical models specific to different domains, the removal of business logic from the communication layer, and migration from services to use the communication layer correctly. We also contributed with a list of possible risks that can affect the payment of the debt, as lack of funding and inadequate prioritization.
Conclusion: We found issues, solutions and possible risks that are specific for microservices architectures not yet encountered in the current literature. Our results may be useful for practitioners that want to avoid or repay Technical Debt in their microservices

Method: A mixed-methods approach with 40 software practitioners from 12 companies was used, combining repeated measurements laboratory experiments and semi-structured interviews. Result: Based on a set of 200 data points, the existence of tiny tangles negatively impacts the valence of software practitioners with more than 99 % certainty. No links were found between professional background and variations in affective state. Moreover, software practitioners receive positive affects from challenging software engineering tasks and negative affects from architectural technical debt and deadlines. Limitation: The subjects were industry professionals obtained through convenience sampling. Additionally, the treatments, albeit similar to industry code, were small and isolated examples that lacked the full spread and severity of technical debt encountered in practice.

In this paper, we emphasize the change in scalability requirements due to new regulations. Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increased workload. For complex systems that are abruptly exposed via open interfaces and hence a greater workload, the scalability requirements may quickly increase, leading to technical debt. We term this scalability debt. This paper describes scalability triage, a light-weight, novel technique for identifying scalability threats as a form of technical debt. We illustrate this technique with an open banking case from a large software organization. Open banking is partly caused by the new European PSD2 regulative that enforce banks to open interfaces to unknown third-party actors. Banking systems are well-established, mature systems. However, with the advent of open banking and PSD2, the workload may quickly rocket. This leads to tougher scalability requirements and accumulated architectural debt, despite previously sound architectural decisions. Using scalability triage, such risks may be identified fast. It will then be possible to prevent this form of technical debt with timely reengineering.</p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8785983?casa_token=JqZSSwow-DcAAAAA:_sZU-rPAEPXj_lbOiOHCzmrOlkBxfjBaZW1_WhHjDQf0J5FwgPhaN5XsBVyiXGSdul9xEYTqsrc">link</a><br><h2>Título 52: Methods for Identifying Architectural Debt: A Systematic Mapping Study</h2><h3>Autores: [Yagup Macit, G{\"o}rkem Giray, Eray T{\"u}z{\"u}n]</h3><h4>Ano: 2020</h4><h4>Local: 2020 Turkish National Software Engineering Symposium (UYMS)</h4><p>Technical debt in general refers to suboptimal decisions the practitioners make during software development that achieve short-term goals at the expense of long-term quality concerns.

The objective of this study is to develop a better understanding of how software development organisations conceptualize their architectural debt, and how they deal with it, if at all. We used a grounded theory method, eliciting qualitative data from software architects and senior technical staff from a wide range of software development organizations.

More software is being created and has to be maintained. Agile methodologies, in particular Scrum, are widely used by development teams around the world. Estimation is an often practised step in sprint planning. The subject matter of this paper is the impact technical debt has on estimations. Objective: The goal of this research is to identify estimation problems and their solutions due to previously introduced technical debt in software projects. Method: The Systematic mapping study (SMS) method was applied in the research. Papers were selected from the popular digital databases (IEEE, ACM, Scopus, etc.) using defined search criteria. Afterwards, a snowballing procedure was performed and the final publication set was filtered using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results: 42 studies were selected and evaluated. Five categories of problems and seven proposed solutions to the problems have been extracted from the papers. Problems include items related to business perspective (delivery pressure or lack of technical debt understanding by business decision-makers) and technical perspective (difficulties in forecasting architectural technical debt impact or limits of source code analysis). Solutions were categorized in: more sophisticated decision-making tools for business managers, better tools for estimation support and technical debt management tools on an architectural-level, portfolio approach to technical debt, code audit and technical debt reduction routine conducted every sprint. Conclusion: The results of this mapping study can help taking the appropriate approach in technical debt mitigation in organizations. However, the outcome of the conducted research shows that the problem of measuring technical debt impact on estimations has not yet been solved.

This concept is transversal to all sciences, especially in experimental physics and systems. However, technical debt is difficult to manage because there is a lack of time, expertise, or knowledge on how to perform it. This paper proposes a computational model of technical debt management in software architecture, based on observations made in software teams in their daily work. This computational model exploits natural language processing and model-testing techniques on software project artifacts to build a model that allows localizing and visualizing the impact produced by the technical debt and its payment strategies. This proposal aims to support teams of architects to explain the current and future impact of the debt injected as a result of decisions made.</p><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1587/1/012020/meta">link</a><br><h2>Título 23: A Semiautomatic Approach to Identify Architectural Technical Debt from Heterogeneous Artifacts</h2><h3>Autores: [Boris P{\'e}rez]</h3><h4>Ano: 2020</h4><h4>Local: European Conference on Software Architecture</h4><p>Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) is a metaphor used to describe decisions taken by software architects to accomplish short-term goals but possibly negatively affecting the long-term health of the system. However, ATD doesn’t receive enough attention for the architect teams because it is hard to identify, to measure, to prioritize, and its value is related to long-term maintenance and evolution of a system. In this research, we propose a model-driven approach that focuses on building a binary classification model for ATD identification based on the information gathered from artifacts produced during architecture design. This model will allow software architects to support the managing of conscious and unconscious ATD in their software projects. This proposal focuses on TD at the architecture-level only without considering source code. The effectiveness of this proposal will be evaluated using case studies and expert interviews.</p><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59155-7_1">link</a><br><h2>Título 12: ATDx: Building an Architectural Technical Debt Index.</h2><h3>Autores: [Roberto Verdecchia, Patricia Lago, Ivano Malavolta, Ipek Ozkaya]</h3><h4>Ano: 2020</h4><h4>Local: ENASE</h4><p>Architectural technical debt (ATD) in software-intensive systems refers to the architecture design decisions
which work as expedient in the short term, but later negatively impact system evolvability and maintainability.
Over the years numerous approaches have been proposed to detect particular types of ATD at a refined level
of granularity via source code analysis. Nevertheless, how to gain an encompassing overview of the ATD
present in a software-intensive system is still an open question. In this study, we present a multi-step approach
designed to build an ATD index (ATDx), which provides insights into a set of ATD dimensions building
upon existing architectural rules by leveraging statistical analysis. The ATDx approach can be adopted by
researchers and practitioners alike in order to gain a better understanding of the nature of the ATD present in
software-intensive systems, and provides a systematic framework to implement concrete instances of ATDx
according to specific project and organizational needs.</p><a href="https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2020/95778/95778.pdf">link</a><br><h2>Título 43: Estimating Refactoring Efforts for Architecture Technical Debt</h2><h3>Autores: [Samir Deeb]</h3><h4>Ano: 2020</h4><h4>Local: </h4><p>Paying-off the Architectural Technical Debt by refactoring the flawed code is important to control the debt and to keep it as low as possible. Project Managers tend to delay paying off this debt because they face difficulties in comparing the cost of the refactoring against the benefits they gain. For these managers to decide whether to refactor or to postpone, they need to estimate the cost and the efforts required to conduct these refactoring activities as well as to decide which flaws have higher priority to be refactored among others.
Our research is based on a dataset used by other researchers in the technical debt field. It includes more than 18,000 refactoring operations performed on 33 apache java projects. To estimate the refactoring efforts done, we applied the COCOMO II:2000 model to calculate the refactoring cost in person-months units per release. Furthermore, we investigated the correlation between the refactoring efforts and two static code metrics of the refactored code, mainly, the LOC and the complexity. The research revealed a moderate correlation between the refactoring efforts and each one of the size of the project and code complexity. Finally, we applied the DesigniteJava tool and machine learning practices to verify our research results. From the analysis we found a significant correlation between the ranking of the architecture smells and the ranking of refactoring efforts for each package.
Using machine learning practices, we took the architecture smells level and the code metrics of each release as an input to predict the levels of the refactoring effort of the next release. We calculated the results using our model and found that we can predict the higher refactoring cost levels with 93% accuracy.</p><a href="https://researchrepository.wvu.edu/etd/7711/">link</a><br><h2>Título 56: How do software architects perceive technical debt in Colombian industry? An analysis of technical debt causes</h2><h3>Autores: [B P{\'e}rez, D Correal, FH Vera-Rivera]</h3><h4>Ano: 2020</h4><h4>Local: Journal of Physics: Conference Series</h4><p>Technical debt is a metaphor used to describe technical decisions that can give the company a benefit in the short term but possibly hurting the overall quality of the software in the long term. Architectural decisions are considered one of the most common sources of technical debt, therefore, it becomes relevant to understand what causes lead to technical debt from the point of view of software architects. To accomplish this task, we used a survey research method to collect and analyze a corpus of 28 software architects from Colombia, as a part of the InsighTD project. Results showed that inappropriate planning is the most cited technical debt cause by software architects. However, results differ when comparison against engineers and manager are performed. Innacurate time estimate and producing more without quality were the most selected causes of technical debt according to engineers and managers. To improve this comparison, the rank-biased overlapping technique was used. As more elements were compared, more similar were these lists of causes among all three roles</p><a href="nan">link</a><br><h2>Título 26: Refactoring Cost Estimation for Architectural Technical Debt</h2><h3>Autores: [Samir Deeb, Mrwan BenIdris, Hany Ammar, Dale Dzielski]</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><h4>Local: International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering</h4><p>Paying-off the Architectural Technical Debt by refactoring the flawed code is important to control the debt and to keep it as low as possible.

We present a summary of current understanding of the technical debt concept and propose a broader application of the approach at a system level. The technical debt metaphor provides a method to identify cases when design or implementation decisions are being made for expediency and assess their long term impact on productivity and risk. In addition, technical debt management offers a logical approach to tracking expedient decisions and determining when it makes sense to carry the debt and when it's better to pay it off by updating designed and retrofitting units. In this paper, we describe various kinds of technical debt that may be present in a system baseline and consider how the presence of debt impacts further evolution of the system. Types of debt include architectural debt, configuration debt, testing debt and deprecation debt among others. We also present use case studies that illustrate how technical debt assessment and management can have a positive impact on system realization. Cases include moving a baseline from R&D to operations, reusing a baseline in a new context, and planning a technical refresh. We discuss methods of managing technical debt in a baseline including identification, quantification, tracking and payoff.</p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9438359?casa_token=DVPA0bn4nCwAAAAA:p-eXnIESlhy8oeBMQ-RX9u1td7sCA_HzrTU3H7q3UGL3U0QCfR5NIcGszz0L1VFD__MzqQ4JkVA">link</a><br><h2>Título 17: The Influence of Cognitive Biases on Architectural Technical Debt</h2><h3>Autores: [Klara Borowa, Andrzej Zalewski, Szymon Kijas]</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><h4>Local: 2021 IEEE 18th International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA)</h4><p>Cognitive biases exert a significant influence on human thinking and decision-making. In order to identify how they influence the occurrence of architectural technical debt, a series of semi-structured interviews with software architects was performed. The results show which classes of architectural technical debt originate from cognitive biases, and reveal the antecedents of technical debt items (classes) through biases. This way, we analysed how and when cognitive biases lead to the creation of technical debt. We also identified a set of debiasing techniques that can be used in order to prevent the negative influence of cognitive biases. The observations of the role of organisational culture in the avoidance of inadvertent technical debt throw a new light on that issue.</p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9426715?casa_token=LCX59lmMZJUAAAAA:GWpprlXcNtlYbqzbEc-KLEJ-BaWWgFfjbhvN65LRZkQwKMTeVS3h5moEKFZ-KnAzOAT0MqPiUzA">link</a><br><h2>Título 15: Identifying architectural technical debt, principal, and interest in microservices: A multiple-case study</h2><h3>Autores: [Saulo Toledo, Antonio Martini, Dag Sj{\o}berg]</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><h4>Local: Journal of Systems and Software</h4><p>Using a microservices architecture is a popular strategy for software organizations to deliver value to their customers fast and continuously. However, scientific knowledge on how to manage architectural debt in microservices is scarce.
In the context of microservices applications, this paper aims to identify architectural technical debts (ATDs), their costs, and their most common solutions.
We conducted an exploratory multiple case study by conducting 25 interviews with practitioners working with microservices in seven large companies.
We found 16 ATD issues, their negative impact (interest), and common solutions to repay each debt together with the related costs (principal). Two examples of critical ATD issues found were the use of shared databases that, if not properly planned, leads to potential breaks on services every time the database schema changes and bad API designs, which leads to coupling among teams. We identified ATDs occurring in different domains and stages of development and created a map of the relationships among those debts.
The findings may guide organizations in developing microservices systems that better manage and avoid architectural debts</p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121221000650">link</a><br><h2>Título 9: Building and evaluating a theory of architectural technical debt in software-intensive systems</h2><h3>Autores: [Roberto Verdecchia, Philippe Kruchten, Patricia Lago, Ivano Malavolta]</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><h4>Local: Journal of Systems and Software</h4><p>Architectural technical debt in software-intensive systems is a metaphor used to describe the “big” design decisions (e.g., choices regarding structure, frameworks, technologies, languages, etc.) that, while being suitable or even optimal when made, significantly hinder progress in the future. While other types of debt, such as code-level technical debt, can be readily detected by static analyzers, and often be refactored with minimal or only incremental efforts, architectural debt is hard to be identified, of wide-ranging remediation cost, daunting, and often avoided.
In this study, we aim at developing a better understanding of how software development organizations conceptualize architectural debt, and how they deal with it. In order to do so, in this investigation we apply a mixed empirical method, constituted by a grounded theory study followed by focus groups. With the grounded theory method we construct a theory on architectural technical debt by eliciting qualitative data from software architects and senior technical staff from a wide range of heterogeneous software development organizations. We applied the focus group method to evaluate the emerging theory and refine it according to the new data collected.
The result of the study, i.e., a theory emerging from the gathered data, constitutes an encompassing conceptual model of architectural technical debt, identifying and relating concepts such as its symptoms, causes, consequences, management strategies, and communication problems. From the conducted focus groups, we assessed that the theory adheres to the four evaluation criteria of classic grounded theory, i.e., the theory fits its underlying data, is able to work, has relevance, and is modifiable as new data appears.
By grounding the findings in empirical evidence, the theory provides researchers and practitioners with novel knowledge on the crucial factors of architectural technical debt experienced in industrial contexts.</p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121221000224">link</a><br><h2>Título 54: Architectural design decisions that incur technical debt—An industrial case study</h2><h3>Autores: [Mohamed Soliman, Paris Avgeriou, Yikun Li]</h3><h4>Ano: 2021</h4><h4>Local: Information and Software Technology</h4><p>Context:
During software development, some architectural design decisions incur technical debt, either deliberately or inadvertently. These have serious impact on the quality of a software system, and can cost significant time and effort to be changed. While current research efforts have explored general concepts of architectural design decisions and technical debt separately, debt-incurring architectural design decisions have not been specifically explored in practice.
Objective:
In this case study, we explore debt-incurring architectural design decisions (DADDs) in practice. Specifically, we explore the main types of DADDs, why and how they are incurred in a software system, and how practitioners deal with these types of design decisions.
Method:
We performed interviews and a focus group with practitioners working in embedded and enterprise software companies, discussing their concrete experience with such architectural design decisions.
Results:
We provide the following contributions: 1) A categorization for the types of DADDs, which extend a current ontology on architectural design decisions. 2) A process on how deliberate DADDs are made in practice. 3) A conceptual model which shows the relationships between the causes and triggers of inadvertent DADDs. 4) The main factors that influence the way of dealing with DADDs.
Conclusion:
The results can support the development of new approaches and tools for Architecture Technical Debt management from the perspective of Design Decisions. Moreover, they support future research to capture architecture knowledge related to DADDs.</p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584921001282?casa_token=Pzcjyf9M96UAAAAA:CLqQROpN51gAlO7FH-t6EZrC8ufwyd_ekXrvrEXiEF5UrCZMDYBQDfYF4SHgsDRPsmxQ5_6zaMc">link</a><br></body></html>
